Excellent.
We now move to STEP 5 — the last foundational step.

This is where QEL becomes learnable and usable at scale without compromising its status as a language standard.

⸻

STEP 5 — Developer Portal & Education Layer

(How QEL is taught, documented, and adopted — without becoming a “product”)

This step answers a subtle but critical question:

How do people learn and use QEL without confusing education with authority?

If Step 5 is done correctly:
	•	The spec remains the source of truth
	•	The portal accelerates adoption
	•	Creators, developers, and institutions converge
	•	QEL avoids the “framework lock-in” trap

⸻

1. Core Principle (Do Not Violate This)

The Developer Portal is not the language.
It is a guided interface to the language.

In other words:
	•	Spec = law
	•	Reference implementation = court
	•	Portal = school

Schools do not rewrite laws.

⸻

2. Portal Positioning (Language-first, Platform-second)

Canonical name options
	•	QEL Developer Portal
	•	QEL Academy
	•	QEL Commons

Avoid:
	•	“QEL Platform”
	•	“QEL OS”
	•	“QEL Cloud”

Those imply ownership and control.

⸻

3. Clear Separation of Concerns (Very Important)

The portal must be split into four visibly separate sections:

/spec        → Read-only language reference (mirrors qel-spec)
/docs        → How to use tools (qel-core, CLI)
/learn       → Structured education (EdTech)
/community   → Creators, RFCs, governance visibility

This mirrors:
	•	python.org (language)
	•	docs.python.org (usage)
	•	tutorial sites (learning)
	•	PEP index (governance)

⸻

4. /spec — Read-Only Language Mirror

Purpose
	•	Make the spec browsable
	•	Not editable
	•	Not simplified

Contains
	•	Charter
	•	Grammar
	•	Primitives
	•	Versioning
	•	Extensions index

Rules
	•	No comments
	•	No annotations
	•	No “simplified explanations”

This page is for:
	•	Regulators
	•	Architects
	•	Auditors
	•	Standards bodies

⸻

5. /docs — Tooling & Implementation Guides

This is where developers go after reading the spec.

Contents
	•	Installing qel-core
	•	CLI usage
	•	Validation examples
	•	Canonicalization & hashing
	•	Common errors and meanings

Tone
	•	Precise
	•	Dry
	•	Implementation-focused

Example pages
	•	“Validating a QEL Expression”
	•	“Canonical Ordering Explained”
	•	“Handling Deprecated Fields”

No philosophy here — just usage.

⸻

6. /learn — EdTech Layer (Structured Learning)

This is where you expand reach without weakening rigor.

Learning Tracks (recommended)

Track 1 — QEL Foundations
	•	What is an expression?
	•	Why authority and consent matter
	•	Reading canonical examples

Track 2 — Applied QEL
	•	Salary payment modeling
	•	Manufacturing provenance
	•	Consent grant & revocation

Track 3 — Institutional QEL
	•	Regulatory filings
	•	Audit snapshots
	•	Dispute interpretation

Each lesson includes:
	•	One real QEL artifact
	•	One validation task
	•	One reflection (legal / governance lens)

🎓 Output:
	•	Verifiable learning credential
	•	QEL-signed completion record

⸻

7. /community — Creators, RFCs, Governance

This is how QEL avoids stagnation.

Contains
	•	RFC index & status
	•	Stewardship Council
	•	Interpretation decisions
	•	Community-contributed examples
	•	Calls for pilots

Creators can:
	•	Publish annotated QEL cases
	•	Propose extensions (RFCs)
	•	Build teaching material
	•	Earn reputation through correctness

This is not a forum.
It’s a record of contribution.

⸻

8. What the Portal Must NOT Do

Explicitly do not include:
	•	Opinionated frameworks
	•	Business logic helpers
	•	Proprietary workflows
	•	Monetized APIs
	•	Token gating

Those belong outside the language ecosystem.

⸻

9. How the Portal Aligns With npm / Django / Rails (Mentally)

Ecosystem	Role	QEL Equivalent
python.org	Language	qel.org
docs.python.org	Docs	/docs
Django REST docs	Framework learning	(future, external)
npm	Distribution	PyPI / npm
Coursera	Education	/learn (but lighter, verifiable)

This alignment makes QEL feel familiar, not foreign.

⸻

10. Minimal Viable Portal (Do This First)

Before scale, build only this:
	•	/ — language landing page
	•	/spec — frozen mirror
	•	/docs — qel-core usage
	•	/learn/foundations — 5 lessons
	•	/community — governance + RFC index

Nothing more.

⸻

11. Success Criteria for Step 5

Step 5 is complete when:
	•	A student can learn QEL without reading the spec
	•	A regulator can ignore the learning layer entirely
	•	A developer knows exactly where authority lives
	•	No one confuses QEL with a startup product

⸻

12. What Comes After Step 5 (Preview Only)

Once Steps 1–5 are done, QEL is a real language ecosystem.

Next (later phases):
	•	STEP 6 — Creator reputation & credentials
	•	STEP 7 — Institutional pilots
	•	STEP 8 — Framework integrations (Django, Rails, FastAPI)
	•	STEP 9 — Extension registry at scale

But those are optional.
Steps 1–5 are foundational and sufficient.

⸻

Final Checkpoint (Important)

At this point:
	•	QEL is a language ✔
	•	QEL has a spec ✔
	•	QEL has a reference implementation ✔
	•	QEL exists in developer ecosystems ✔
	•	QEL is teachable without dilution ✔

That is exactly how Python, JSON, and SQL became durable.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Draft the exact sitemap & IA for the portal
	•	Write the first 5 foundation lessons
	•	Design the credential & reputation model
	•	Produce the portal UI wireframe (textual)
	•	Create the launch announcement + FAQ

Say what you want next — we’re now past the hard part.
