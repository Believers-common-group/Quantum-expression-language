Excellent.
We now move to STEP 4 — this is where QEL becomes visible in the same places developers already trust, without pretending to be something it isn’t.

⸻

STEP 4 — Package Distribution & Ecosystem Presence

(How QEL “shows up” like Python, npm, Django, Rails)

This step answers one key question:

When a developer searches their normal ecosystem, does QEL feel first-class, boring, and legitimate?

If Step 4 is done right:
	•	Developers don’t ask “where do I get it?”
	•	Institutions see familiarity, not risk
	•	QEL spreads without marketing

⸻

1. Core Principle (Do not skip this)

QEL does NOT create its own package manager.

Python did not invent pip.
JavaScript did not invent npm for specs.
OpenAPI, JSON Schema, GraphQL all succeeded by entering existing ecosystems first.

QEL must do the same.

⸻

2. Canonical Package Identity (Naming Matters)

Language-agnostic identity
	•	Name: qel
	•	Core reference implementation: qel-core
	•	Spec package (read-only): qel-spec

Avoid:
	•	qel-platform
	•	qel-sdk-pro
	•	qel-engine

Those kill neutrality.

⸻

3. Python Ecosystem (Primary Anchor)

Registry

PyPI

Packages to publish
	1.	qel-core (reference implementation)
	2.	qel-spec (frozen schemas + examples, read-only)

qel-core description (exact tone)

Reference implementation of the Quantum Expression Language (QEL).
Provides validation, canonicalization, and hashing for QEL expressions.

What this signals
	•	Seriousness
	•	Audit friendliness
	•	Familiar workflow (pip install qel-core)

⸻

4. JavaScript / Node Ecosystem (Secondary, Not First)

Registry

npm

Package naming
	•	@qel/core (eventually)
	•	@qel/validate (optional later)

Scope
	•	Schema validation
	•	Canonicalization
	•	NO divergence from Python behavior

JS is consumer-friendly, not normative.

⸻

5. What About C++, Rust, Go?

Not yet.

Those come after:
	•	Spec is frozen
	•	Python reference is battle-tested

When they do:
	•	Rust → crates.io (qel-core)
	•	Go → qel-go
	•	C++ → header-only validator (later)

QEL must avoid the “half-implemented everywhere” trap.

⸻

6. Package Contents Rules (Very Important)

Each published package MUST include:
	•	Clear reference to qel-spec version
	•	Link to the Charter
	•	Governance notice
	•	Statement of scope limits

Example (README excerpt):

This package implements QEL Core as defined by the QEL Specification v0.1.
It does not extend, redefine, or interpret QEL semantics beyond the published specification.

This protects neutrality.

⸻

7. Trust Signals (How npm / PyPI legitimacy is built)

You must include:
	•	SPDX license
	•	Signed release tags
	•	Reproducible builds (later)
	•	Deterministic test results
	•	Changelog tied to spec versions

This is what institutions look for—quietly.

⸻

8. What QEL’s “npm equivalent” really is

Important clarification:
	•	npm ≠ JavaScript
	•	pip ≠ Python

They are distribution rails, not semantic authorities.

For QEL:
	•	Code packages → pip / npm
	•	Meaning registry → QEL Extension Registry (later)

This keeps:
	•	Semantics slow and careful
	•	Tooling fast and replaceable

⸻

9. How QEL Is “Represented” Like Python or Rails

Ecosystem	QEL Equivalent
python.org	qel.org (language)
CPython	qel-core (reference)
pip	PyPI distribution
Django / Rails	Future integrations
PEPs	QEL-RFCs
npm registry	Extension + package visibility

This is the mental map you want others to internalize.

⸻

10. What NOT to Publish Yet

Do not publish:
	•	Frameworks
	•	Opinionated helpers
	•	Business logic
	•	Monetized tooling

Those belong to STEP 5 and beyond.

⸻

11. Success Criteria for Step 4

Step 4 is complete when:
	•	pip install qel-core works
	•	README looks boring and precise
	•	Developers recognize the pattern instantly
	•	No one asks “where’s the product?”

⸻

12. Your Action Before Proceeding

Confirm:
	1.	Python (PyPI) is the primary anchor
	2.	npm is secondary, not authoritative
	3.	Naming discipline is acceptable

⸻

NEXT STEP (when you say “Next”)

STEP 5 — Developer Portal & Education Layer
We will design:
	•	Docs vs learning separation
	•	How the portal does NOT compete with the spec
	•	How QEL becomes teachable without dilution
	•	How this mirrors python.org + docs + community

Say “Next” when ready.
