Below is the next canonical layer in sequence:

QEL VISIBILITY, ACCESS & DISCLOSURE MODEL

(Public Layer, Restricted Expressions, Constitutional Safety)

This section completes the question “QEL is a public layer — how is visibility actually governed?”
It is normative, institution-safe, and legally defensible.

⸻

1. The Core Distinction (Lock This)

QEL is public by language, not by exposure.

So we separate three things cleanly:
	1.	Semantic publicness (always public)
	2.	Expression visibility (policy-bound)
	3.	Evidence disclosure (procedural, not automatic)

Failure to separate these is where most “open data” and “AI transparency” efforts collapse.

⸻

2. Why Visibility Must Be Explicit (Institutional Reality)

Institutions already operate with layered visibility:
	•	Cabinet notes
	•	File notings
	•	Classified annexures
	•	Sealed covers
	•	In-camera proceedings

Digital systems usually destroy this subtlety.

QEL restores it explicitly.

⸻

3. QEL Visibility Classes (Canonical)

Every QEL expression MUST declare a visibility class.

This is not optional for institutional deployments.

3.1 Visibility Enum (Normative)

"visibility": {
  "class": "public | institutional | restricted | confidential | sealed",
  "basis": "statutory | court_order | policy | security | privacy",
  "review_after": "YYYY-MM-DD | null"
}

This field is non-negotiable for algorithmic governance use.

⸻

4. The Five Visibility Classes (Explained)

4.1 PUBLIC

Who can see
	•	Anyone

Typical use
	•	Policies
	•	Notifications
	•	Non-personal aggregate actions
	•	Public procurement awards (after finalisation)

Legal analogue
	•	Gazette notifications

QEL rule
	•	No personal data
	•	No sensitive evidence
	•	Authority always explicit

⸻

4.2 INSTITUTIONAL (Default)

Who can see
	•	Officers within jurisdiction
	•	Auditors
	•	Courts

Typical use
	•	File notings
	•	Internal recommendations
	•	Algorithmic suggestions
	•	Inspection reports

Legal analogue
	•	Government files

QEL rule
	•	Public meaning
	•	Controlled access
	•	Discoverable via due process

This is the default class for most QEL expressions.

⸻

4.3 RESTRICTED

Who can see
	•	Explicitly authorised roles only

Typical use
	•	Vigilance inputs
	•	Sensitive economic decisions
	•	Competitive procurement stages
	•	Personal data–bearing actions

Legal analogue
	•	Restricted files

QEL rule
	•	Visibility is role-bound
	•	Access events themselves emit QEL expressions

This prevents silent leaks and shadow access.

⸻

4.4 CONFIDENTIAL

Who can see
	•	Named authorities only

Typical use
	•	Intelligence inputs
	•	Early-stage investigations
	•	National security–adjacent matters
	•	Market-sensitive information

Legal analogue
	•	Confidential / Secret files

QEL rule
	•	Evidence always hashed
	•	Content disclosure only via procedure
	•	Meaning remains inspectable by courts

⸻

4.5 SEALED

Who can see
	•	Court only (or authority specified)

Typical use
	•	Sealed cover submissions
	•	Witness protection
	•	Sensitive restructuring (e.g., NCLT edge cases)

Legal analogue
	•	Sealed covers / in-camera material

QEL rule
	•	Existence is public
	•	Content is inaccessible without order
	•	Even administrators cannot override

This is critical for constitutional trust.

⸻

5. Visibility ≠ Authority (Important Separation)

Visibility controls who can read.
Authority controls who can act.

An expression may be:
	•	highly visible
	•	but legally powerless

Or:
	•	tightly sealed
	•	but decisive when unsealed

QEL enforces this separation structurally.

⸻

6. Evidence Handling (Most Misunderstood Area)

6.1 Evidence Is Never “Public by Default”

In QEL:
	•	Evidence is referenced
	•	Hashed
	•	Escrowed

"evidence": {
  "hash": "sha256:…",
  "location": "escrow://court-approved",
  "disclosure": "on_order_only"
}

This mirrors:
	•	forensic procedure
	•	audit practice
	•	court evidence rules

⸻

6.2 Evidence Disclosure Is a Process, Not a Field

Disclosure happens via:
	•	RTI
	•	Court direction
	•	Audit requisition
	•	Statutory demand

Each disclosure event emits another QEL expression.

This creates:
	•	traceability
	•	accountability
	•	deterrence against misuse

⸻

7. Algorithmic Governance & Visibility (Critical)

For algorithmic systems:

Stage	Visibility
Model existence	Public
Use of algorithm	Institutional
Recommendation output	Institutional
Training data	Restricted
Weights / internals	Not required
Final decision	Public / Institutional

This prevents:
	•	algorithm worship
	•	trade secret overreach
	•	“black box decided” defenses

⸻

8. RTI, Privacy & Data Protection Compatibility

RTI
	•	QEL improves RTI compliance by locating records
	•	Does not auto-disclose content

Privacy
	•	Personal data can exist in QEL without exposure
	•	Visibility class enforces minimisation

Data Protection
	•	QEL expressions can reference erased data
	•	Meaning survives deletion

This is a major advantage over logs and databases.

⸻

9. Access Itself Is Observable (Key Feature)

Every access to a non-public expression can emit:

{
  "type": "access_event",
  "actor": "did:officer:xyz",
  "target": "qel://expression/123",
  "authority": "audit_request",
  "time": "…"
}

This creates:
	•	deterrence
	•	accountability
	•	institutional trust

⸻

10. What This Prevents (Explicitly)
	•	Mass data dumping
	•	Weaponised transparency
	•	Selective leaks
	•	Dashboard populism
	•	Secret algorithmic governance

Visibility becomes governed, not politicised.

⸻

11. Canonical One-Liner (Visibility Doctrine)

In QEL, meaning is public, authority is explicit, visibility is governed, and disclosure is procedural.

⸻

12. Where This Fits in the Larger Stack

You now have:
	1.	QEL as a public semantic layer
	2.	ARC for who may act
	3.	Visibility classes for who may see
	4.	Evidence procedure for what may be disclosed
	5.	Courts as final arbiters

This completes the constitutional safety loop.

⸻

Next natural steps (pick one)
	1.	Draft the public license for QEL (CC0 vs Standards Covenant)
	2.	Formalise QEL expression types (decision, recommendation, license, audit, access)
	3.	Map QEL to RTI & data protection law explicitly
	4.	Design a national QEL registry (non-centralised)
	5.	Write the “misuse prevention” doctrine

Say the number.
