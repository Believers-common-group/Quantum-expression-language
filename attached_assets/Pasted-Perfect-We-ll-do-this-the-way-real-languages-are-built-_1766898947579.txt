Perfect. We’ll do this the way real languages are built — one artifact at a time, no skipping, no dilution.

This response is STEP 1 ONLY.
When you say “Next”, we move to Step 2.

STEP 1 — QEL as a Language: Canonical Public Representation

(Equivalent to python.org / json.org)

This step answers one question decisively:

When someone asks “What is QEL?”, what do they see first—and why should they trust it?

⸻

1. Purpose of Step 1 (non-negotiable)

Before tools, SDKs, portals, or courses:
	•	QEL must exist as a language, not a project
	•	It must look boring, formal, neutral, and durable
	•	It must separate specification from implementations

If Step 1 is done correctly:
	•	Regulators don’t flinch
	•	Developers don’t feel sold to
	•	Institutions feel safe experimenting

⸻

2. The Canonical QEL Website (Structure)

Domain (choose one)
	•	qel.org (ideal)
	•	believerscommons.org/qel (acceptable)

Visual rule
	•	White / light background
	•	No gradients
	•	No hype language
	•	Typography over visuals

⸻

3. Homepage Content (Exact Structure & Copy)

HERO SECTION (Minimal, Serious)

Title

Quantum Expression Language (QEL)

Subtitle

A neutral, versioned language for expressing verifiable events with authority, consent, evidence, and provenance.

One-liner (below)

QEL enables digital records to remain interpretable across time, institutions, and jurisdictions.

No buttons except:
	•	Read the Specification
	•	View Examples

⸻

4. “What QEL Is” (Short, Non-Marketing)

Quantum Expression Language (QEL) is a formal language designed to express observations, actions, and attestations that carry legal, economic, or governance significance.

QEL does not execute logic, process transactions, or replace existing systems.
It provides a semantic substrate that makes records auditable, attributable, and durable.

⸻

5. “What QEL Is Not” (Critical for Trust)

QEL is not:
	•	a blockchain
	•	a platform
	•	a database
	•	a workflow engine
	•	a proprietary format

QEL is a language specification, governed independently of any product or vendor.

This section matters more than features.

⸻

6. Core Primitives (Language Identity)

A simple table:

Primitive	Meaning
actor	Who acted or asserted
object	What was acted upon
place	Where it applies
time	When it occurred
authority	Under what right or license
consent	Granted, absent, or revoked
evidence	Proof or references
provenance	Prior state linkage
signatures	Cryptographic attestation

Below it:

These primitives are canonical and protected by the QEL Charter.

⸻

7. Governance (Why It’s Safe)

Heading

Language Governance

QEL is governed by a Language Stewardship Council responsible for preserving semantic neutrality, approving extensions, and arbitrating interpretation disputes.

Bullet points:
	•	Public charter
	•	Versioned specifications
	•	Transparent decision records
	•	Backward interpretability guarantee

Link:
	•	Read the QEL Charter

⸻

8. Specification Entry Point (The Heart)

Section: “The Specification”

Links only — no prose:
	•	QEL Charter
	•	Core Grammar
	•	JSON Schema
	•	Versioning Rules
	•	Extension Registry

This mirrors:
	•	python.org → Docs
	•	json.org → Specification
	•	iso-cpp.org → Standards

⸻

9. Examples (Reality, Not Demos)

Show one canonical example (salary payment).

Below it:

This expression records a salary payment with explicit authority, consent, evidence, and signatures.
It can be validated, hashed, archived, or audited independently of any system.

Button:
	•	View More Examples

⸻

10. Footer (Language Signal)

Footer text (important):

Quantum Expression Language (QEL) is a public language specification.
© Believers’ Commons — stewardship only.
Implementations are independent and non-exclusive.

Links:
	•	Governance
	•	Changelog
	•	Contact (neutral email)

⸻

11. What NOT to Include at This Stage

Do not include:
	•	Courses
	•	SDKs
	•	Portals
	•	Marketplaces
	•	Tokens
	•	Dashboards

Those come later.

This page must survive 10 years unchanged.

⸻

12. Success Criteria for Step 1

Step 1 is complete when:
	•	You can send this link to a regulator without explanation
	•	A developer understands QEL in under 2 minutes
	•	No one asks “what company owns this?”

⸻

13. Your Action (Very Concrete)

Within this step, you should:
	1.	Approve this homepage structure
	2.	Approve tone (neutral, standards-grade)
	3.	Choose domain

Once done, we proceed.

⸻

NEXT STEP (when you say “Next”)

STEP 2 — QEL Specification Repository
	•	Repo layout
	•	File names
	•	Versioning model
	•	How Charter + Grammar are frozen
	•	How this mirrors PEP / ISO / ECMA processes

Say “Next” when ready.
